Copy the files in this directory into their corresponding locations in the Rails application

Changes:

		server name/ip and application name
	- config/environments/staging.rb

			application_github_repository
	-config/recipes
		- database.rb

Database.yml
=====
The local database.yml file should be .gitignored. The Capistrano script will create a database.yml file from teh file in templates. Once on the server, this file will need to have the password filled in so that the connection will work. This servers to keep the database password out of the remote repo.

Deployment
======

1. Make sure /etc/sudoers has this setting; otherwise nothing will work.

    ** Fabric script should do this for you. **
    %sudo   ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL

2. Create database on target server and give appropriate permissions (see goodtoknow for sql commands).

3. Put the two SSL cert files in place.  Find the files on Dropbox.

    $ sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/certs
    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/certs/api.<stage>.ravidapp.com.chain.cert
    $ sudo nano /etc/nginx/certs/privkey.pem

    $ sudo chmod 755 /etc/nginx/certs
    $ sudo chown -R root:root /etc/nginx/certs

4. Deploy directory setup

    $ cap [stage] deploy:setup

5. Edit database.yml in shared directory

    $ nano /home/ravidapp/www/<stage>.ravidapp.com/shared/config/database.yml

5.5 cap [stage] unicorn:setup

6. ... and deploy(cold)

    $ cap [stage] deploy:cold

7. Rename server hostname

    $ sudo nano /etc/hostname
    $ sudo nano /etc/hosts

8. Reboot

    $ sudo reboot

9.
    $ cap <stage> unicorn:setup
    $ cap <stage> nginx:setup

10. optional - install & configure server monitoring (copperegg, monit, etc)
